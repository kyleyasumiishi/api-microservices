# api-microservices

This website will have all the API and microservice projects from FreeCodeCamp, which will be accessible to every visiter. It will also have the ability to create an account and save microservice requests. I'll use Node/Express and MongoDB/Mongoose for the backend.

I'll make the toggle menu button look like the menu icon with three lines. I'll also add a login button to the main page. The login tab in the nav bar will change depending on whether user is logged in.

Additionally, I plan to use Pug as a template engine and Jest as a test suite.

After completing the site, I'll deploy to Heroku.
